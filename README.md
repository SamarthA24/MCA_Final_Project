## Introduction
<p>
Healthcare industries generate vast volumes of data that contain hidden insights useful for diagnostics and decision-making. This study focuses on developing a Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) utilizing Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms to assess the risk of heart disease based on 13 clinical parameters (e.g., age, sex, cholesterol, obesity, etc.). The system also incorporates a multilayer perceptron neural network trained with backpropagation to improve predictive capabilities. The results demonstrate that HDPS can effectively identify patterns and relationships among medical variables, supporting doctors and patients with informed decisions regarding heart health.

### Objective
<p>
  The primary goal is to implement a Heart Disease Prediction System capable of extracting meaningful insights from historical health data. The system will leverage data mining and machine learning to assist in diagnosing heart conditions, thereby aiding healthcare professionals and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
